Welcome to rUNSWift
===================

Firstly, we hope you completed [Getting Started](../../wiki/Getting-Started) successfully.

* If so, please create a [GitHub Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your public SSH key.
* If not please join us on the [rUNSWift Slack](https://runswift.slack.com) and ask for help.

That's basically it - we use [PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to get at least two sets of eyes on all non-trivial changes.

The RoboCup SPL is a software competition, meaning it's about working as a team to read and write the best code. We hope to see you contributing soon!
